# Screening Test â€“ Summer Internship under Dr. Abhijit Chandra - Analytics Dashboard Assessment

## ðŸš— EV Dashboard by Mahurima Paul

This is a fully interactive dashboard that analyzes and visualizes the Electric Vehicle (EV) Population Dataset. It enables users to dynamically explore trends in EV makes, models, types, range distribution, and city-wise registrations. The dashboard also supports dark mode, filtering based on dataset columns, dropdown for displaying graphs on click, and PDF export.
